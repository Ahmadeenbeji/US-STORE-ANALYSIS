# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
1.	Total sales revenue is 2,297,200.88 and this revenue increases yearly from 2014-2016. The revenue declined in 2017 and 2018 from what was observed in the peak of 2016.
2.	A 12.5% profit margin can be deemed outstanding for one company and unsatisfactory for another. Hence, it's crucial to assess this margin within its specific context. The profit, as indicated by the trendline, displays a gradual and fluctuating increase over the years. The most prominent surge occurs from the 1st quarter to the 4th quarter annually. The pinnacle of profitability was attained in the 4th quarter of 2016, followed by a sharp decline in the 1st quarter of the subsequent year, with a subsequent gradual recovery until the 1st quarter of 2018. Understanding the market dynamics and factors driving this observable trend is imperative, particularly in the context of the 4th quarter, which is influenced by seasonal demands, holiday sales, and inventory management. Companies frequently establish yearly performance targets, with the 4th quarter serving as the final opportunity to meet these objectives, thereby motivating endeavors to enhance profits in the concluding quarter.
3.	The mean shipping duration was calculated to be 4 days, with the shortest and longest shipping durations being 1 and 7 days, respectively. This information provides insights into potential shipping delays that can occur when transporting goods. Notably, customer behavior plays a pivotal role in the order fulfillment process. It was observed that a significant number of customers favor the standard shipping mode, increasing the likelihood of goods being delivered within the average timeframe, with the majority arriving between 5 and 7 days. Factors like delivery cost may explain the prevalence of this delivery choice. While the order fulfillment process is efficient, it's important to recognize that achieving even higher efficiency may entail additional costs.
4.	The Western region recorded the highest sales, accounting for 31.58% of total sales. This prompts questions about why the region with the most substantial discounts ended up with the lowest profit. The company faces a decision point: should it consider offering the region with the highest sales and profits even greater discounts to further boost customer loyalty and patronage?
